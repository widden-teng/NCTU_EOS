## HW
### hw1
- Please develop a delivery system on the Raspberry Pi. 
- This system should enable customers to place orders seamlessly and receive their freshly prepared delivered meals as desired.
### hw2
- This assignment will build upon the content from hw1. 
- The original standalone version of the delivery system will be modified using a socket server to create a version that supports connections.
### hw3
- This assignment will extend the content from hw2. 
- Using processes or threads, the server will be transformed into a multi-client version capable of handling race conditions appropriately.
